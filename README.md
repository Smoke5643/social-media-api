# Social Media API


  ## Desciption
  
  The Social Media API application is a back-end express driven platform to handle a social media website. You have the ability to manage users, thoughts, and reactions to those thoughts. Users can also become friends and delete friends. You could potentially add your own front-end to this and have a deployable function webpage.
